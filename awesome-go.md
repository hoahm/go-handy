I was inspired by [Awesome Ruby](https://github.com/chaps-io/awesome-ruby), so that I make another Awesome Go by myself for references later.

# Awesome Go

## Getting started

* [Golang Bootcamp](http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book/frontmatter) - Everything you need to know to get started with Go.
* [Golang cheatsheet](https://github.com/a8m/go-lang-cheat-sheet)
* [Go wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki) - Worth to read

## Algorithms

* [Go-algorithms](https://github.com/0xAX/go-algorithms) - implementation of different algorithms and data structures

## Concurrent

* [Understanding mutex](http://www.alexedwards.net/blog/understanding-mutexes)

## Data structures

### Built-in data structures
* [Linked list](https://golang.org/pkg/container/list/) - Builtin linked list
* [Heap](https://golang.org/pkg/container/heap/) - Builtin heap
* [Ring](https://golang.org/pkg/container/ring/) - Builtin ring
* [Implement data structure set using map](https://repl.it/@hoahm/Go-data-structure-set-using-map)

### Custom data structures
* [Go data structures](https://github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures) - A collection of useful, performant, and threadsafe Go datastructures.
* [GoDS](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods) - Another collection of Go data structures.
* [Set data structure](https://github.com/fatih/set) - Set data structure for Go
* [Another set data structure](https://github.com/deckarep/golang-set) - A simple set type for the Go language

## IDE

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Free, open source IDE for many different programming languages, including Golang.
* [Go for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go) - An extension for VS Code which provides support for the Go language.

## Packages

* [Understanding Golang packages](https://thenewstack.io/understanding-golang-packages/)
* [Organizing Go code](https://talks.golang.org/2014/organizeio.slide#1)

## RESTFUL framework

* [7 frameworks to build a restful API](https://nordicapis.com/7-frameworks-to-build-a-rest-api-in-go/) - Good start if you are new to Go and do not know which framework is best suit for your needs.
* [Golang + Revel + Mongodb (revel_mgo)](https://medium.com/@kyawmyintthein/revel-mgo-restful-generator-for-revel-web-framework-mongodb-86209de3977e) 

## Strings

* [Tips for using strings](https://www.calhoun.io/5-tips-for-using-strings-in-go-2/) - 5 Tips for Using Strings in Go

## Testing frameworks

* [Ginko](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) - a BDD-style Golang testing framework.
* [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) - a matcher/assertion library, best paired with Ginko.
* [Goconvey](http://goconvey.co/) - write behavioral tests and get live results in your browser.

## Tricks

* [Interface operator](http://www.golangpatterns.info/object-oriented/operators) - Golang do not allow operator overloading. So operator as a method or operator as a function are two approaches to deal with this limitation.
* [Polimorphism & Reflection using interface](http://www.tapirgames.com/blog/golang-interface)

## Unit tests

* [Golang basics - writing unit tests](https://blog.alexellis.io/golang-writing-unit-tests/)
* [Testing in Golang](https://medium.com/@thejasbabu/testing-in-golang-c378b351002d)
* [Getting started with BDD in Go using Ginkgo and Gomega](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-bdd-in-go-using-ginkgo) - It's worth to start from this tutorial.
* [Composing Gomega matcher](http://eng.rightscale.com/2015/11/30/composing-gomega-matchers.html)
